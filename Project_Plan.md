# Project Plan: Analyzing OSS Project Lifecycles using GH Archive Data to Guide Adoption and Exit Timing

---

## 1. Introduction & Problem Statement

The adoption of Open Source Software (OSS) is integral to modern development but presents strategic challenges. Knowing **when** to adopt a new OSS project (avoiding early instability vs. missing innovation) and **when** to migrate away from an existing one (avoiding technical debt and obsolescence) are critical decisions. This project aims to address these challenges by leveraging historical data on OSS project activity.

## 2. Project Goal & Objectives

* **Goal:** To perform a descriptive data analysis of the GH Archive dataset to identify patterns and metrics indicative of OSS project health, maturity, and lifecycle stages (growth, stability, decline).
* **Objectives:**
    * Identify key activity metrics derivable from GH Archive event data (e.g., commits, issues, PRs, forks, stars, contributor activity, bug fix rates).
    * Analyze trends in these metrics over time for a selection of OSS projects.
    * Describe characteristic patterns associated with different phases of an OSS project's lifecycle.
    * Develop a data-informed heuristic guide suggesting indicators for optimal OSS adoption ("get in") and migration ("get out") points.

---

## 3. Proposed Value

This project will provide significant value by:

* **Reducing Risk:** Helping organizations make more informed decisions about adopting OSS, minimizing risks associated with immature or unstable projects.
* **Improving Efficiency:** Enabling teams to identify potentially declining or unmaintained dependencies earlier, prompting timely migration and reducing future technical debt.
* **Providing Quantitative Insights:** Moving beyond anecdotal evidence to offer data-driven indicators of project health and trajectory.
* **Benchmarking:** Potentially allowing for the comparison of activity patterns across different projects or domains.

## 4. Data Source

* **Primary Data:** The **GH Archive dataset** (`https://www.gharchive.org/`). This dataset contains timed event data for public GitHub repositories.
* **Data Period:** As per the source documentation, the dataset covers up to January 2015. The analysis will focus on the last 10 years covered by the dataset.

## 5. Methodology & Analysis Plan

### A. Identify Salient Features & Lifecycle Indicators
Based on GH Archive event types, define and track metrics related to key aspects of OSS projects:

* **Initiation & Growth:**
    * `CreateEvent`: Repository creation.
    * `ForkEvent`: Rate of forks (community interest/potential contribution).
    * `WatchEvent` (Stars): Rate of stars (popularity/visibility).
    * `PushEvent`: Commit frequency, volume of code changes.
    * `IssuesEvent` / `PullRequestEvent`: Initial activity rates.
    * `MemberEvent`: Growth in collaborators/contributors.
* **Maturity & Stability:**
    * `IssuesEvent`: Ratio of closed/open issues, especially those labeled "bug"; Time-to-close for issues.
    * `PullRequestEvent`: PR acceptance rate, time-to-merge PRs, frequency of PRs addressing bugs.
    * `PushEvent`: Consistent commit activity from core contributors.
    * `ReleaseEvent`: Regularity and type (major/minor/patch) of releases.
    * `IssueCommentEvent` / `PullRequestReviewCommentEvent`: Active discussion and review process.
* **Community Engagement:**
    * Breadth of contributors (number of unique actors in `PushEvent`, `IssuesEvent`, `PullRequestEvent`).
    * Responsiveness in comments (`IssueCommentEvent`).
* **Potential Decline or Risk:**
    * Decreasing trends in commits, PRs, issue closures, stars, forks.
    * Increasing time-to-close for issues/PRs.
    * Decrease in active core contributors (`PushEvent`, `MemberEvent`).
    * High ratio of open/stale bugs (`IssuesEvent`).
    * Infrequent or ceased releases (`ReleaseEvent`).
    * Potential increase in `DeleteEvent` (branches/tags), though context is needed.

### B. Data Extraction & Processing
* Select a diverse sample of OSS projects (based on domain, size, known success/failure, etc.) or analyze trends across broader categories.
* Use Spark to extract relevant event data (`type`, `created_at`, `repo.name`, `actor.login`, payload details like issue labels, PR merge status) for the selected projects/categories over the chosen time frame.
* Aggregate data by time intervals (e.g., monthly, quarterly) to calculate the defined metrics. Clean data as necessary.

### C. Descriptive Analysis & Pattern Identification
* Visualize the trends of the key metrics over time for each project or category.
* Compare patterns across projects representing different lifecycle stages (if known).
* Identify characteristic shapes or thresholds in the metrics that correlate with perceived growth, maturity, and decline phases. For example:
    * **Get In Signal:** Sustained growth in stars/forks, increasing commit frequency, active issue closure (especially bugs), regular releases, growing contributor base.
    * **Get Out Signal:** Prolonged decline in commit/PR activity, rising number of stale/unresolved critical bugs, departure of core maintainers, cessation of releases.

---

## 6. Expected Outcome & Deliverables

* A final technical report detailing the methodology, analysis, findings, and limitations.
* Visualizations (time-series graphs, comparative charts) illustrating OSS project lifecycle patterns based on the analyzed metrics.
* A set of data-driven heuristics or a "playbook" summarizing key indicators and patterns that can guide practitioners on favorable times to adopt ("get in") and potentially migrate away from ("get out") OSS projects.

---

## 7. Scope & Limitations

* The analysis is **descriptive**, not predictive. It identifies past patterns, which may not perfectly forecast the future.
* Analysis depth may be limited by available computational resources on Jojie.
* Project success/failure or lifecycle stage definition might be subjective and require careful consideration or external validation.
* Variations in how projects utilize GitHub features (e.g., issue labels, release tagging) can affect metric consistency.
* The analysis focuses on public activity data recorded in the GH Archive; private contributions or community dynamics outside GitHub are not captured.
