    "# Analyzing OSS Projects under the Apache Software Foundation using GH Archive Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to analyze the open-source software (OSS) projects using the GH Archive dataset. The goal is to provide insights that can help in making decisions regarding the adoption and exit timing of OSS projects managed by the Apache Software Foundation.\n",

    "The scope of the analysis will be limited to the following aspects:\n",
    "1. **Project Owner** - Only projects under the `apache` organization will be considered.\n",
    "2. **Time Period** - The analysis will only include data from the year 2020 to 2025.\n"

With compression applied and the file format changed to parquet, the data copied over to the EC2 volume was 22 GB."
